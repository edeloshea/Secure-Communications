import xor from pwn
define key1 and convert the provided key from hex to bytes
define key2
since we have the XOR'd value of key1 and key2, we can use the XOR function with key1 to find key2
Step 5 is repeated but for key3
find the XOR of key1, key2 and key3
find flag by using the xor function with the key provided and the results of step 7
