define and initiate the variables
define 'found' a boolean value and set it to false
create a while loop until the found value is set to true
for each value between 2 and p, check if the function is equal to 1. 
    if it gets to 1, add 1 to g and start the while loop again
    if n = p-2, we've found the value
    print p
    break the while loop by setting found to true
