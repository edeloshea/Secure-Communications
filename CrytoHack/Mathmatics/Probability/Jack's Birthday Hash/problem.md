Today is Jack's birthday, so he has designed his own cryptographic hash as a way to celebrate.

Reading up on the key components of hash functions, he's a little worried about the security of the JACK11 hash.

Given any input data, JACK11 has been designed to produce a deterministic bit array of length 11, which is sensitive to small changes using the avalanche effect.

Using JACK11, his secret has the hash value: JACK(secret) = 01011001101.

Given no other data of the JACK11 hash algorithm, how many unique secrets would you expect to hash to have (on average) a 50% chance of a collision with Jack's secret?
